## Deployment Configuration

### CORS Settings
The backend is configured to allow requests from:
1. Local Development:
   - http://localhost:3000
   - http://localhost:8000

2. Production:
   - https://loyalty-design-delta.vercel.app

3. Preview Deployments:
   - https://loyalty-design-delta-*.vercel.app
   - https://loyalty-design-delta-git-*.vercel.app
   - Generic pattern: https://*.vercel.app
   - Regex pattern: https://loyalty-design-delta.*\.vercel\.app

### Deployment Steps
1. Backend (Railway):
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Set environment variables
   FRONTEND_URL=https://loyalty-design-delta.vercel.app
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

2. Frontend (Vercel):
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://web-production-9eb2.up.railway.app
   ```

### Troubleshooting
1. CORS Issues:
   - Check allowed origins in main.py
   - Verify frontend URL matches patterns
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check network requests in browser dev tools

2. Import Errors:
   - Verify all models are defined
   - Check __init__.py files
   - Confirm requirements are installed

3. Environment Variables:
   - Verify all required variables are set
   - Check for typos in variable names
   - Ensure values are properly formatted
