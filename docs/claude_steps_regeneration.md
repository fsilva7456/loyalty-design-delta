# Regeneration Feature Implementation Steps

Implementing regeneration functionality across all workflow steps.

## 1. Initial Analysis
Feature Requirements:
- Allow users to request regeneration of any step
- Capture user feedback for improvements
- Maintain context from previous generation
- Handle all step types consistently

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Base Components ✅
- [x] Create base service class (services/base_service.py)

  - Added regeneration prompt construction
  - Added shared error handling
- [x] Create regeneration models (models/regeneration.py)
  - Added RegenerationRequest model
  - Added type definitions
- [x] Create frontend modal component (frontend/src/components/RegenerationModal)
  - Added feedback form
  - Added styling and accessibility
  - Added proper event handling
- [x] Create regeneration context (frontend/src/components/StepForm/RegenerationContext.tsx)
  - Added state management
  - Added context provider
  - Added hooks for easy access

### Step 2: Backend Implementation ✅
