## Environment Setup

### Backend (.env)
```bash
# Railway environment variables
FRONTEND_URL=https://loyalty-design-delta.vercel.app
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### Frontend (.env)
```bash
# Vercel environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://web-production-9eb2.up.railway.app
```

## Deployment Steps

### Backend (Railway)
1. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
2. Deploy with updated CORS configuration
3. Verify API is accessible

### Frontend (Vercel)

   - Verify request payload format
   - Check API logs for errors

### Network Issues
1. API Timeouts:
   - Check API health endpoint
   - Verify Railway service is running
   - Check for rate limiting

2. Connection Errors:
   - Verify API is accessible
   - Check for DNS issues
   - Confirm network connectivity
