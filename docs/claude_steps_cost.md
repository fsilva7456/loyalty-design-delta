# Cost Estimation Page Implementation Steps

Following the process outlined in docs/add-new-page.md to implement the cost estimation page.

## 1. Initial Analysis ✅
Based on the workflow, the cost estimation page will:
- Follow the loyalty mechanics step
- Use previous step data including:
  - Customer segments
  - Loyalty objectives
  - Selected mechanics
  - Company and industry context

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Backend Models ✅
Created `models/cost_estimation.py` with:
- SetupCost model
- OperationalCost model
- MemberCost model
- ROIProjection model
- CostEstimationRequest model
- CostEstimationResponse model

### Step 2: Backend Service ✅
Implemented `services/cost_estimation.py` with:
- GPT-4 integration for cost calculations
- Detailed prompt engineering
- Response validation and processing
- Comprehensive cost breakdowns

### Step 3: Backend Router ✅
Added `routers/cost_estimation.py` with:
- POST endpoint for cost estimation
- Dependency injection
- Error handling

### Step 4: Frontend Form ✅
Created `frontend/src/components/StepForm/CostEstimationForm/index.tsx`:
- Displays selected mechanics
- Shows customer segments overview
- Calculates total member base
- Handles data validation

### Step 5: Frontend Results ✅
Created `frontend/src/components/StepForm/CostEstimationResult/index.tsx`:
- Setup costs table
- Operational costs breakdown
- Per-member cost analysis
- ROI projections
- Cost-saving opportunities
- Risk factors

### Step 6: Integration ✅
Updated StepForm component:
- Added imports for new components
- Added cost_estimation case to renderForm
- Added cost_estimation case to renderResult
- Implemented proper data passing

## Testing Checklist
1. Form Submission
   - [ ] Verify mechanics data loads correctly
   - [ ] Check customer segment totals
   - [ ] Test submission process

2. Results Display
   - [ ] Verify all cost tables render correctly
   - [ ] Check calculations accuracy
   - [ ] Test responsive design

3. Data Flow
   - [ ] Test company/industry persistence
   - [ ] Verify previous step data access
   - [ ] Check error handling

## Next Steps
1. Complete testing checklist
2. Add loading states
3. Implement error recovery
4. Add data validation warnings
5. Consider adding cost adjustments functionality
