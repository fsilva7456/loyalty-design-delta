# Loyalty Mechanics Page Implementation Steps

Following the process outlined in docs/add-new-page.md to implement the loyalty mechanics page.

## 1. Initial Analysis
Based on the workflow, the loyalty mechanics page will:
- Follow the loyalty objectives step
- Use previous step data including:
  - Customer segments
  - Loyalty objectives
  - Company and industry context

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Form Component ✅
Created `frontend/src/components/StepForm/LoyaltyMechanicsForm/index.tsx`
- Implemented form using shared UI components
- Connected to WorkflowContext
- Added access to previous step results

### Step 2: Create Result Component ✅
Created `frontend/src/components/StepForm/LoyaltyMechanicsResult/index.tsx`
- Displays mechanics recommendations
- Shows implementation roadmap
- Lists success metrics
- Includes detailed implementation information

### Step 3: Update Step Form Index ✅
Updated form switcher in `frontend/src/components/StepForm/index.tsx`
- Added imports for new components
- Added case for loyalty_mechanics in renderForm()
- Added case for loyalty_mechanics in renderResult()
- Connected to previous step results

### Step 4: Add to Navigation Flow ✅
Validated StepNavigator in `frontend/src/components/StepNavigator/index.tsx`
- Component supports dynamic step sequences
- No changes needed to the component itself
- Step needs to be included in steps array where used

### Step 5: Backend Implementation ✅
Implemented required backend components:

#### Models ✅
Created `models/loyalty_mechanics.py`
- MechanicsRecommendation model
- LoyaltyMechanicsRequest model
- LoyaltyMechanicsResponse model

#### Service ✅
Created `services/loyalty_mechanics.py`
- Implemented GPT-4 integration
- Added prompt construction
- Added response processing

#### Router ✅
Created `routers/loyalty_mechanics.py`
- Added POST endpoint for mechanics generation
- Implemented error handling

### Step 6: Main App Update ✅
Updated `main.py`
- Added loyalty_mechanics router import
- Included router in FastAPI app

### Step 7: Bug Fixes and Improvements ✅

#### Data Persistence Fix (2024-03-25)
Fixed issue with company name and industry data not persisting correctly:
- Added getCompanyAndIndustry helper function to centralize data retrieval
- Updated logic to check all previous steps for company/industry data
- Improved error handling and data validation
- Fixed warning message appearing incorrectly

Changes made in:
- frontend/src/components/StepForm/index.tsx
  - Added getCompanyAndIndustry helper function
  - Updated loyalty_mechanics and loyalty_objectives cases
  - Improved data flow between steps

## Testing Checklist
1. Form Submission
   - [ ] Verify data from previous steps is loaded
   - [ ] Check form validation
   - [ ] Test submission process

2. Navigation Flow
   - [ ] Confirm correct step sequence
   - [ ] Test navigation between steps
   - [ ] Verify data persistence

3. Data Processing
   - [ ] Test API endpoint
   - [ ] Verify GPT-4 response handling
   - [ ] Check error scenarios

4. UI/UX
   - [ ] Test responsive design
   - [ ] Verify loading states
   - [ ] Check error messages

## Next Steps
1. Run comprehensive testing
2. Add error handling improvements if needed
3. Consider adding analytics tracking
4. Plan for future optimizations
